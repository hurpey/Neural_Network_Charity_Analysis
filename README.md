# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis**

This analysis uses machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, using the features in the provided dataset.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively


**Results**

Data Preprocessing
- The columns `EIN` and `NAME` are identification information and have been removed from the input data.
- The column `IS_SUCCESSFUL` contains binary data refering to weither or not the charity donation was used effectively. This variable is then considered as the target for our deep learning neural network.
- The following columns `APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT` are the features for our model. Encoding of the categorical variables, spliting into training and testing datasets and standardization have been applied to the features.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- This deep-learning neural network model is made of two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons respectively.\
The input data has 43 features and 25,724 samples.\
The output layer is made of a unique neuron as it is a binary classification.\
To speed up the training process, we are using the activation function `ReLU` for the hidden layers. As our output is a binary classification, `Sigmoid` is used on the output layer.

For the compilation, the optimizer is `adam` and the loss function is `binary_crossentropy`.
- The model accuracy is under 75%. This is not a satisfying performance to help predict the outcome of the charity donations.
- To increase the performance of the model, we applied bucketing to the feature `ASK_AMT` and organized the different values by intervals.\
We increased the number of neurons on one of the hidden layers, then we used a model with three hidden layers.\
We also tried a different activation function (`tanh`) but none of these steps helped improve the model's performance.


**Summary**

The deep learning neural network model did not reach the target of 75% accuracy. Considering that this target level is pretty average we could say that the model is not outperforming. We can use asupervised machine learning such as the Random Forest Classifier to combine a multitude of decision trees to generate a classified output and evaluate its performance against our deep learning model.
